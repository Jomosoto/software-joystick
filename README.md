# Arduino joystick

This repo allows you to emulate a joystick via an arduino connected via a serial port (on Linux only).
I put this together for my raspberry pi based games console, in order to avoid having to attach a usb joystick.

This repo comes with an accompanying blog post [here](https://gwilym.dev/2021/02/virtual-joystick-on-linux/).
